# AzureDevOpsPwsh
Module of functions wrapped around the Azure DevOps REST API

# Why AzureDevOpsPwsh?
This is for folks that feel comfortable with PowerShell, but may not know the ins and outs of the Azure DevOps REST API. Currently there are a minimal amount of tools to interactive with Azure DevOps, so I wanted to make things a little easier in an automated fashio for the community.
